Welcome to Fuzzy System's documentation!
========================================

**FuzzySystem** is a python framework to build Fuzzy Inference Systems easy to use and very configurable. It is made by following the literary conventions in the Fuzzy Logic domain area.

This project aims to bring academics and researchers an easy-to-use tool to teach or perform experiments related to fuzzy systems. You will be able to configure and extend the classes to add more functionality and robustness to them. If you work in Matlab-like or python solutions to create fuzzy control systems, this framework will make you feel comfortable.




Installation
____________



**FuzzySystem** framework is compatible with **Python**>3.6, and can be easily installed using **pip**:
