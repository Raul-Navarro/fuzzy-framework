# fuzzy-framework

**FuzzySystem** is a python framework to make Fuzzy Inference Systems easy to use and flexible. It is made by following the literary conventions in the Fuzzy Logic domain area.

This project aims to bring academics and researchers an easy-to-use tool to teach or perform experiments related to fuzzy systems. You will be able to configure and extend the classes to add more functionality and robustness. If you work in Matlab-like or python solutions to create fuzzy control systems, this framework will make you feel comfortable.

# Installation
